no locking (i.e. '*): I don't see why you'd do this, as you're leaving yourself open to breaking changes. but as
long as you test after you build it should be fine...? (not if there are subtle issues, though).

lock major version: the default behavior in semver, since major versions can have backwards incompatible changes.

lock minor version: security issues? new features causing poor performance? or, you want to freeze the scope of
the dependency to reduce complexity (e.g. Neovim stops at Lua 5.1.x. There's hash tables in 5.3.0, but they don't
want to introduce that complexity, even if it is backwards compatible.

lock patch version: perhaps useful if there's a security bug in the next patch, but no fix patch
yet released.
